**We are currently soliciting presentation proposals.
If you wish to present your work at the gem5 Workshop then please consult our [Call For Presentations](#call-for-presentations) section**.

## Call for Presentations

The gem5 simulator is an open-source platform that enables the modeling and simulation of computer systems at different levels of abstraction, including processor, memory hierarchy, and interconnects.
It is widely used in academia and industry for research, education, and design space exploration.
Now on its 5th iteration, the gem5 Workshop gives community stakeholders a chance to present their contributions and ideas, as well as engage in discussion with the wider community.

In this call we are soliciting presentation proposals from researchers, developers, and practitioners who are using or developing the gem5 simulator.
The workshop will be co-located with [ISCA '23](https://iscaconf.org/isca2023/) (June 17th to 21st, in Orlando, Florida) with the goal of giving community members an opportunity to share their gem5-related research and insights, exchange ideas, and collaborate on future gem5 development goals.

This year we want to give **anyone** who wishes to an opportunity to present gem5-related topics at the workshop.
As such we are foregoing Program Committee evaluation and will allocate presentation/discussion time based on what we believe will invoke the most discussion.
In short, as long as a presentation proposal is covering a gem5-related topic, we will allocate a time for it at the workshop.
Ideas and contributions, big or small, are welcome.

Examples of gem5 topics which could be presented include, but are not limited to:

* Improvements made to gem5.
* Simulator research carried out with gem5.
* Proposals for improving gem5.
* Early-stage simulator research ideas (this can be a solicitation for feedback from the community).
* Proposals and comments on gem5 development practices.
* Research concerning gem5 or architecture simulators in a general sense.

Above all else, we will welcome any talk if it can be justified as being of interest to those who use and develop gem5.

To reward those who have helped improved the project, this year we we will be awarding the _Award for gem5 Development Excellence_ to a worthwhile presenter.
This purpose of this award is to acknowledge those who have made contributes to the gem5 code-base.
