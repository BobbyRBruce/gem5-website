We are happy to announce the first gem5 Boot Camp, to be held at UC Davis from July 11th to July 15th 2022.
The purpose of the gem5 Boot Camp is for junior computer architecture researchers, particularly PhD. students, to learn how to use gem5 in their projects.
The Boot Camp, held over 5 days, will take attendees through setting up basic system simulations, creating your own components, learning to interpret gem5 status, and up to running and modifying simulations comparable to real-world systems.

**This event is free for all accepted attendees**. There is no cost for registration, accommodation and meals will be provided, and travel grants are available.

## Key Dates

* Boot camp: **July 11th to July 15th 2022**

## When and where is the Boot Camp?

The Boot Camp will be held from July 11th to July 15th 2022 at UC Davis in Davis, California.
Attendees will attend workshop sessions each day, typically from 9AM to 5PM.
Accommodation will be sponsored by NSF from July 10th to July 16th (6 nights).

## What should attendees expect?

There will be 5 full days of workshop activities centered around learning gem5.
The workshop will start with the assumption of no prior experience using gem5 and aims to go give attendees a solid and broad foundation of knowledge of gem5 in carrying out computer architecture research.

The workshop will give attendees the opportunity to:

* Learn how to create SimObjects.
* Learn how to use the gem5 Standard Library to create simulations.
* Get to grips with gem5art.
* Understand the gem5 statistics module and how to use it in your experiments.
* Create full system simulations capable of running real-world operating systems and software benchmarks.
* Network with others in the computer architecture research community.

And much, much more!

Breakfast, lunch, and dinner will be provided, as well as afternoon snacks.
Attendees will be hosted on campus with evening social events planned.

## Who can apply?

Anyone can apply though, as spaces are limited, preference will be given to early career researchers (e.g., first or second year PhD and masters students planning on applying for a PhD).
We especially encourage those from non-research universities, minority serving institutions, and universities without PhD programs to apply.

## How can I apply?

We are not yet ready to process applications to attend this event.
If you wish to be notified when we are ready, please register your interest here: <https://forms.gle/AztSG3mD2BqQ4f967>.


## What does it cost?

This event is sponsored by the NSF.
There will be no cost to attend.
Accommodation on the UC Davis campus, meals, and social events will be provided as part of the event.

We will be offering travel grants which can be applied for to cover transport expenses after the event.
